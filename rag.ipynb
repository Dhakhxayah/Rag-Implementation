      "*   **Consider your location:** If you live in an area with consistently very cold temperatures, you might want to consider setting it a few degrees higher (e.g., 60°F or 16°C) for extra protection.\n",
      "*   **Other things to consider:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Insulation:** Ensure your home is properly insulated, especially around pipes in exterior walls or unheated areas like basements and crawl spaces.\n",
      "    *   **Circulation:** Open cabinet doors under sinks to allow warmer air to circulate around the pipes.\n",
      "    *   **Dripping faucets:** Let faucets drip slightly, especially those on exterior walls.  This constant movement of water can prevent freezing.\n",
      "    *   **Smart Thermostat:** Consider a smart thermostat that you can monitor and adjust remotely.\n",
      "    *   **Have someone check on your house:** If possible, ask a neighbor or friend to check on your house periodically, especially during extreme cold weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important note:** Even with these precautions, there's always a *small* risk of pipes freezing during prolonged periods of extreme cold. If you're concerned, consider having your plumbing professionally winterized.\n",
